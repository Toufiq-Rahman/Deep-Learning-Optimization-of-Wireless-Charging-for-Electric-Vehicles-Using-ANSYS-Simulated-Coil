# Deep-Learning-Optimization-of-Wireless-Charging-for-Electric-Vehicles-Using-ANSYS-Simulated-Coil


This project leverages ANSYS Electronic Desktop simulation to design coils for a Wireless Power Trans-
fer (WPT) system, generating a diverse dataset for various scenarios. Deep learning techniques are then
applied to optimize wireless charging for electric vehicles (EVs), aiming to enhance efficiency and per-
formance
